## ^^ doesnt make sense bc there is no point in predicting the assignment to treatment...
## but how to put 5 regressions into 1 predicted probability model??

## individual predicted probabilities:
newdata <- data.frame(n_treatement = 1, cca2 = 5, dem = 1)
predict(log_taxcorp, newdata, type = "response")
